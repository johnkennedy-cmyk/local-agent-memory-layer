# LAML Memory — same behavior as repo root

You have access to the **LAML** (Local Agent Memory Layer) MCP server (`laml`) for persistent memory.

**Follow the same rules as the repo root `.cursorrules`:** init_session at conversation start (use a stable `user_id`, e.g. `default` or the machine username), recall_memories for context, add_to_working_memory after each substantive exchange, checkpoint_working_memory at boundaries, and store_memory at milestones. Do this in every session without being asked.

- **user_id**: Use a stable identifier (e.g. `default`) so long-term memories are tied to the same user across sessions.
- **session_id**: Use the value returned from init_session for all working-memory calls in this conversation.
- Use **get_relevant_context** when you need combined working + long-term context.
- Pin important working-memory items; use entity tags in store_memory when relevant.
